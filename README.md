==Quick Intro==

Dogetiles is a basemap designed for Dogecoin and other Doge memes.

Quirky labels mimic the Doge meme and maps sites relevant to Dogecoin (the cities
where Shiba Inus are from, where Dogecoin was first created, where the first pizza
was bought for Dogecoin, etc).

==Longer Intro==

Dogetiles bring together a string of unrelated items:

* Doge is a meme of an entertaining Shiba Inu dog

* Bitcoin is a digital currency. Each Bitcoin is highly valued so prices are
often listed as a decimal or in mBTC (milliBitcoins).

* Litecoin is digital currency similar to Bitcoin, but using a different algorithm
to change how mining works, and with more coins available (so 1 Litecoin
is valued less than 1 Bitcoin).

* Dogecoin is a digital currency based on Litecoin and the Doge meme. There
are more Dogecoins available than Bitcoin or Litecoin, and billions of coins
are available each year, so there is less value per coin.
A positive effect is that you tipping someone 10-30 Dogecoin costs only a few cents.

* <a href="http://coinmap.org">CoinMap</a> is a resource for finding locations
to spend Bitcoin and Litecoin in real life (restaurants, shops, services).

* <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> is a wiki-map where
volunteers map the world. A business that accepts Bitcoin can be tagged
"payment:bitcoin=yes", and a business that accepts Dogecoin should be tagged
"payment:dogecoin=yes". Only do this for physical businesses that a customer
can visit! CoinMap and this map regularly update their locations from
OpenStreetMap.

* GeoJSON is a good format for map data. Dogepoints.geojson is a list of points
where cool stuff has happened with Doge and Dogecoin!

* <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill">TileMill</a> is an application to make
maps from data. The style.mss file in this project controls how
country borders and Dogepoints should appear on the map.

* GitHub (this site) is a site for collaborating on code and data. This is an
open source project! With a GitHub account you can

to resolve, or click 'fork' to use this code for your own project.
